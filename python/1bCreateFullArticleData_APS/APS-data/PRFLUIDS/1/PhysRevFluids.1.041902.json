Gordillo and collaborators [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2014.397\"><span>J. Fluid Mech.</span> <b>754</b>, R1 (2014)</a>] have shown that the symmetrical stationary cusp is the only structure accommodating for both mass and momentum conservation at a steadily receding liquid sheet rim. Cusps are also known to typically move along a sheet border, to present an asymmetry, and to be distributed in size around a mean. We show here why a heterogeneous assembly of cusps traveling along the sheet rim occurs spontaneously, why big and small cusps coexist at the same time, and, more precisely, we establish a specific link between the microscopic dynamics directing their motion, and the ensemble averaged distribution of their sizes.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"f5372742-fa5e-4bda-96ba-87e45d98bae6","label":"Interfacial flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"8939314c-888d-47be-9fc8-d481ef4879d4","label":"Free-surface flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

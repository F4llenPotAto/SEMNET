The skin-friction drag reduction method proposed by these authors, consisting of streamwise-invariant, counter-rotating vortices, was analyzed by Canton <i>et al.</i> [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10494-016-9723-8\"><span>Flow, Turbul. Combust.</span> <b>97</b>, 811 (2016)</a>] in turbulent channel flows for friction Reynolds numbers (<span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mtext>Re</mtext><mi>τ</mi></msub></math></span>) corresponding to the value of the original study (i.e., 104) and 180. For these <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Re</mtext></math></span>, a slightly modified version of the method proved to be successful and was capable of providing a drag reduction of up to 18%. The present study analyzes the Reynolds number dependence of this drag-reducing strategy by performing two sets of direct numerical simulations (DNS) for <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msub><mtext>Re</mtext><mi>τ</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>360</mn></mrow></math></span> and 550. A detailed analysis of the method as a function of the control parameters (amplitude and wavelength) and <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Re</mtext></math></span> confirms, on the one hand, the effectiveness of the large-scale vortices at low <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Re</mtext></math></span> and, on the other hand, the decreasing and finally vanishing effectiveness of this method for higher <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Re</mtext></math></span>. In particular, no drag reduction can be achieved for <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msub><mtext>Re</mtext><mi>τ</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mn>550</mn></mrow></math></span> for any combination of the parameters controlling the vortices. For low Reynolds numbers, the large-scale vortices are able to affect the near-wall cycle and alter the wall-shear-stress distribution to cause an overall drag reduction effect, in accordance with most control strategies. For higher <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Re</mtext></math></span>, instead, the present method fails to penetrate the near-wall region and cannot induce the spanwise velocity variation observed in other more established control strategies, which focus on the near-wall cycle. Despite the negative outcome, the present results demonstrate the shortcomings of the control strategy and show that future focus should be on methods that directly target the near-wall region or other suitable alternatives.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"a3ff37a7-c0a4-48a9-a32f-0dbc060c2746","label":"Navier-Stokes equation","facet":{"id":"b96dac97-ab85-4320-892d-9b245caf097f","label":"Theoretical Techniques"}},{"id":"062f0300c33d4782b24c43996b0469f3","label":"Turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"eb3a78ac-532d-4225-a765-5b6ccf672cd0","label":"Internal flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

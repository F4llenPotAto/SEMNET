Normally, a user-defined large-scale portion of the input forms the large-scale content in the prediction by scaling its amplitude, as well as temporally shifting the signal to account for the physical inclination of these scales. Incoherent smaller scales are then fused to the prediction via universally expressed fluctuations that are subject to an amplitude modulation. Here we present a refined version of the model using spectral linear stochastic estimation, which eliminates a user-defined scale separation of the input. Now, an empirically derived transfer kernel comprises an implicit filtering via a scale-dependent gain and phase; this kernel captures the coherent portion in the prediction. An additional refinement of the model embodies a relative shift between the stochastically estimated scales in the prediction and the modulation envelope of the universal small scales.

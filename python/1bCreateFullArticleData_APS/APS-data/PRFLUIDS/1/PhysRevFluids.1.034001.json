In the present work we show experimentally that this nanoscale mechanism can induce changes in the macroscale mixing of colloids by chaotic advection. Rather than the decay of the standard deviation of concentration, which is a global parameter commonly employed in studies of mixing, we instead use multiscale tools adapted from studies of chaotic flows or intermittent turbulent mixing: concentration spectra and second and fourth moments of the probability density functions of scalar gradients. Not only can these tools be used in open flows, but they also allow for scale-by-scale analysis. Strikingly, diffusiophoresis is shown to affect all scales, although more particularly the small ones, resulting in a change of scalar intermittency and in an unusual scale bridging spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. By quantifying the averaged impact of diffusiophoresis on the macroscale mixing, we explain why the effects observed are consistent with the introduction of an effective Péclet number.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"63f8b3b2-4f01-4ed3-8256-e8c63afc6ddb","label":"Particle-laden flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"44a0c2f3-f61d-456b-9f35-8f2f585edd12","label":"Mixing & reactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

We first consider the elastohydrodynamics of a ball bearing and the motion of a gas bubble inside a thin channel. It is shown that there is a strong analogy between these two lubrication problems, and the respective scaling laws are derived side by side. Subsequently, the paper focuses on the limit where the involved elastic interfaces become extremely soft. It is shown that soft gels and elastomers, like liquids, can be shaped by their surface tension. We highlight some recent advances on this class of elastocapillary phenomena.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"2bd35371-7fda-477a-8e1a-c346c797a232","label":"Polymers & Soft Matter"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"131dafdf93a44e0abba0a8b40cb90b6c","label":"Wetting","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"4e823153-8e04-4bdb-a7ca-0f608ecd9453","label":"Tribology","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"2cea1c8c-c8ee-4576-a697-73e0371d9428","label":"Lubrication","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"fe83f0b4fdcd46789ead9a735befaecb","label":"Adhesion","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"eef7c13bc67f4d33be9776cee58e700a","label":"Surface & interfacial phenomena","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

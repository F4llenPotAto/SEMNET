In this paper, magnetic resonance imaging is used to measure the velocities of the gas and solid phases in a bubbling fluidized bed. Comparison with theory shows that the average velocity of gas through the interstices between particles is predicted correctly by classic analytical theory. Experiments were also used to validate predictions from computer simulations of gas and solid motion. The experiments show a wide distribution of gas velocities in both bubbling and emulsion regions, providing a different direction for computational and analytical theory.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"780edcc1-705f-432b-9121-76105d540fe1","label":"General Physics"},{"id":"a48f173e-6459-4642-a711-a6e731807625","label":"Condensed Matter & Materials Physics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"fee9296a01ca4b8086bf2c51f37c1871","label":"Nuclear magnetic resonance","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}},{"id":"6558d12a54c24ef78a5b67ba06aaab9d","label":"Multiscale modeling","facet":{"id":"1e0c099a-9f2a-4e47-b3f1-7faa28b6a506","label":"Computational Techniques"}},{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"38bac9c1-bf64-489f-ae94-8434562d24a2","label":"Fluidized beds","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"cc73b723-a501-45c2-a121-f8c9757c5573","label":"Flows in porous media","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

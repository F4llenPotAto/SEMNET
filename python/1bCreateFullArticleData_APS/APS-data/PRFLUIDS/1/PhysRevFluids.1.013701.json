An analytic solution is found if all steps have equal vertical extent. From this solution, bounds are established for the relative incident horizontal wave number and frequency of waves that have negligible transmission, a result that is independent of the number of steps. If the step sizes vary randomly about a mean vertical extent, the transmission can be computed numerically for several random realizations. Provided the horizontal wavelength is much longer than the total vertical extent of the staircase, the standard deviation of the computed transmission coefficients is small and the mean agrees well with the analytic prediction for equally spaced steps. The results are applied to thermohaline staircases observed in the ocean in order to put lower bounds on the wavelengths of long inertia gravity waves that significantly transmit to great depth.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"133ff954-fb67-4d15-ae83-a684a1463dd6","label":"Stratified geophysical flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"787d6f81-9f93-4997-9978-cba2419977ca","label":"Oceanography","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

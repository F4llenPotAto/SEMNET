By using numerical modeling we show that the mutual (backflow) coupling between the flow velocity and the orientation director field of the nematic liquid crystal leads to the formation of positive umbilic defects at local peaks and to the formation of negative umbilic defects at the local saddles in the flow profile. The number of flow peaks and the index of the flow saddles (i.e., the number of the valleys) are shown to be directly related to the strength of the umbilic defect, effectively relating the two fields at the geometrical level. The regular arrangement of the barriers in the porous channels is demonstrated to lead to the formation of regular lattices of umbilic defects, including square, triangular, and even kagome lattices. Experimental realization of such systems is discussed, with particular focus on microfluidic-tunable birefringent photonic band structures and lattices.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"5c98e96f-9b4d-4af7-9105-c87cd60b2ab5","label":"Flows in microchannels","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"edff6507-ef6e-4655-88ac-33fa3e31b6fb","label":"Microscale flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"eaca2279-c165-4d8d-9d90-993209240f9e","label":"Low Reynolds number swimmers","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"0c3836054e3f46fa90d04b63324f4a84","label":"Nematic liquid crystals","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true}]}}}

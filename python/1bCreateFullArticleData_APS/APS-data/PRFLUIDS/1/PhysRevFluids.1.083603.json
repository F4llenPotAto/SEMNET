A theoretical model is implemented which captures the Soret effect and the dependence of surface tension on both temperature and solutal concentration. The model also allows for variation in the density of the liquid mixture with thermal and solutal differences. A linear stability analysis is performed with asymptotic and numerical results being obtained. The coupling of the effect of a variable density with the thermosolutal-Marangoni instability and the Soret effect is investigated. Good agreement with previous results for the constant density case is found.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"50adc7d0-14e7-4a61-82ce-46d54feb45a9","label":"Instability of free-surface flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"8f585b75-23e9-4388-afe5-364824c412da","label":"Surface tension effects","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

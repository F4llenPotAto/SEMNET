Pair synchronization is a fundamental requirement for these collective dynamics, but it is generally not sufficient for collective phase-locking, chiefly due to the effect of long-range interactions. Here we explore experimentally and numerically a minimal model for a ciliated surface: hydrodynamically coupled oscillators rotating above a no-slip plane. Increasing their distance from the wall profoundly affects the global dynamics, due to variations in hydrodynamic interaction range. The array undergoes a transition from a traveling wave to either a steady chevron pattern or one punctuated by periodic phase defects. Within the transition between these regimes the system displays behavior reminiscent of chimera states.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"0e9db8ef-5aa8-40bc-a0c8-9d93f5fcc2eb","label":"Biological Physics"},{"id":"e4211828-5d99-4bc4-b986-eb2bbbc8b248","label":"Interdisciplinary Physics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"3b66172c-b80b-47f5-85cc-8ee5c2e80fe4","label":"Flagella","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true},{"id":"55539a3d11b84ce7b55602c59dcba864","label":"Synchronization transition","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"5b3df46f481241968c687fb8577cdd80","label":"Synchronization","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"747386d5-d15e-43fe-890c-abafe7aad8f2","label":"Self-organization","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"ae9bb97e-75e5-4183-a8e8-281ddf26e234","label":"Emergence of patterns","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

The stratification changes the interface geometry, and a large part of the interface is oriented with normal in the vertical direction in the stratified flows. The structures of the T/NT interface layer are similar between the nonstratified and stratified flows, and the T/NT interface consists of the viscous superlayer and the turbulent sublayer. The stratification is locally strengthened near the T/NT interface as evidenced by the large vertical density gradient, resulting in the decrease in <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mtext>Re</mtext><mi>b</mi></msub></math></span> in the T/NT interface layer. Thus, even the small-scale dissipation range is directly affected by the buoyancy near the T/NT interface, although the small scales are somewhat free from the direct effects of the buoyancy in the turbulent core region. The production rates of enstrophy and scalar dissipation, which arise from the strain/vorticity and strain/density-gradient interactions, are decreased near the T/NT interface because the stratification modifies the alignments among the vorticity, density gradient, and strain-rate eigenvectors near the T/NT interface. This influence on the small-scale turbulence dynamics is not observed in the turbulent core region because of the large <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mtext>Re</mtext><mi>b</mi></msub></math></span>. A possible explanation is given for the influence of buoyancy on the alignment statistics based on the suppression of the vertical turbulent motions by buoyancy.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"8e117b54-7f83-4338-928f-e41ed5d2de22","label":"Shear layers","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"062f0300c33d4782b24c43996b0469f3","label":"Turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

We employ the unified gas-kinetic scheme to investigate these cross coupling effects in gas flows in micro-channels. Our numerical simulations cover channels of planar surfaces and also channels of ratchet surfaces, with Onsager's reciprocal relation verified for both cases. For channels of planar surfaces, simulations are performed in a wide range of Knudsen number, and our numerical results show good agreement with the literature results. For channels of ratchet surfaces, simulations are performed for both the slip and transition regimes, and our numerical results not only confirm the theoretical prediction [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.164502\"><span>Phys.

Finally, a preliminary optimization study is carried out for the geometry of Knudsen pump based on channels of ratchet surfaces.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"419d860ece5c42f1b6ad4dee9f4fbf60","label":"Statistical Physics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"e38df1f9-82e0-4177-b924-8e0507956d6f","label":"Transport processes","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"cd403d00-d86b-41dc-a6fb-72bc3a302627","label":"Nonequilibrium & irreversible thermodynamics","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"99934578-7c4c-4b59-9edd-cd7dc8988a58","label":"Kinetic theory","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"6f991c28-112d-4bdf-9c2c-50cec44f48fe","label":"Rarefied flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"c7102703-2c55-4648-bf60-11f0f66a1256","label":"Nanoscale flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"edff6507-ef6e-4655-88ac-33fa3e31b6fb","label":"Microscale flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

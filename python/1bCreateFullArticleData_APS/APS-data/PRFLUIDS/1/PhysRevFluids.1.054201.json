These are particles whose motion is invariant under rotations but not under mirror reflections of the particle. This is the simplest, yet unexplored, extension of the much studied case of small spherical particles. We show that heavy isotropic helicoids, due to the coupling between translational and rotational degrees of freedom, preferentially sample different helical regions in laminar or chaotic advecting flows. This opens the way to control and engineer particles able to track complex flow structures with potential applications to microfluidics and turbulence.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"780edcc1-705f-432b-9121-76105d540fe1","label":"General Physics"},{"id":"6f025065-4b96-4156-b146-2c285d0994c4","label":"Nonlinear Dynamics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"b35ee7c0-e5d2-4843-aeb7-811d8fe82473","label":"Turbulent multiphase flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"63f8b3b2-4f01-4ed3-8256-e8c63afc6ddb","label":"Particle-laden flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"5cf50e0b-bcbc-491b-9fb3-4684dc9a20e5","label":"Mixing","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

It is well know that shock interaction with a single particle results in nonmonotonic drag on the particle and that the peak force is an order of magnitude greater than the steady-state force. However, there is currently a substantial lack of numerical results for shock propagation over multiple particles. We therefore compute the unsteady inviscid drag coefficient as a function of time for the fcc array of particles and investigate the effect of varying the shock Mach number and the volume fraction. We compare the unsteady drag for the fcc array against the unsteady drag for a single spherical particle and against the unsteady drag for a structured one-dimensional array of spherical particles and make relevant observations. We also plot the local Mach number contours to explain the various observed complex physical mechanisms occurring during shock-particle interaction. Finally, since shock interaction with particles lead to transmitted and reflected waves, we compute the average pressure in the computational domain to characterize the strength of the transmitted shock wave to study pressure attenuation behind the particle barrier. By analyzing the pressure field we can determine the effect of particles on the flow.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"c577bd62-ea57-43b7-9607-1ef45dba3afb","label":"Multiphase flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

In particular, we focus on qualitative changes in the morphology and behavior of stationary sliding drops. We employ the inclination angle of the substrate as control parameter and use continuation techniques to analyze for several fixed droplet sizes the bifurcation diagram of stationary droplets, their linear stability, and relevant eigenmodes. The obtained predictions on existence ranges and instabilities are tested via direct numerical simulations that are also used to investigate a branch of time-periodic behavior (corresponding to repeated breakup-coalescence cycles, where the breakup is also denoted as <i>pearling</i>) which emerges at a global instability, the related hysteresis in behavior, and a period-doubling cascade. The nontrivial oscillatory behavior close to a Hopf bifurcation of drops with a finite-length tail is also studied. Finally, it is shown that the main features of the bifurcation diagram follow scaling laws over several decades of the droplet size.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"6f025065-4b96-4156-b146-2c285d0994c4","label":"Nonlinear Dynamics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"795375d2194f4f098b48acc3c7c5dd4b","label":"Drops","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true},{"id":"4c251551-f31e-43ab-a789-701616a6cea1","label":"Drop breakup","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"8939314c-888d-47be-9fc8-d481ef4879d4","label":"Free-surface flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"f5372742-fa5e-4bda-96ba-87e45d98bae6","label":"Interfacial flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"af1f8b12-9181-4c18-a750-d9e9fe621217","label":"Bifurcations","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

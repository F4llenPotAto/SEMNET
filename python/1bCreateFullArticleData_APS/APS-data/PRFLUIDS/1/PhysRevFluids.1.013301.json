The slow rate of decay of the particle-induced polymer stress with separation from a particle presents a challenge to the derivation of the average stress, which can be overcome by removing the linearized polymer stress disturbance before computing the bulk average stress from the particle-induced disturbance. The linearized stress can be shown to have zero ensemble average. The polymer influence on the particle's stresslet is computed with the aid of a generalized reciprocal theorem based on a regular perturbation from Newtonian flow for small polymer concentration. The analysis shows that the particle-polymer contributions to the shear stress and first normal stress difference shear thicken as has been observed in the experiments of Scirocco <i>et al.</i> [Shear thickening in filled Boger fluids, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1122/1.1849185\"><span>J. Rheol.</span> <b>49</b>, 551 (2005)</a>]. The particle-polymer contribution to the second normal stress difference is positive at small Deborah numbers but changes sign at a Deborah number of about 2.3.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"87e64a0fc93544dda3efae868d3a6389","label":"Rheology","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"8c304260-0dba-4a63-908f-bab534c0a876","label":"Viscoelasticity","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

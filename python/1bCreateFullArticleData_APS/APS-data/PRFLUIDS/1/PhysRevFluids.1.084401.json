We find that the azimuthal rotation velocity <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>θ</mi><mo>̇</mo></mover><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></span> and thermal amplitude <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>δ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></span> of the large-scale circulation (LSC) are modulated by the forcing, exhibiting a variety of dynamics including increasing phase delays and a resonant peak in the amplitude of <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>θ</mi><mo>̇</mo></mover><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></span>. We also focus on the influence of modulated rotation rates on the frequency of occurrence <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>η</mi></math></span> of stochastic cessation or reorientation events, and on the interplay between such events and the periodically modulated response of <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>θ</mi><mo>̇</mo></mover><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></span>. Here we identify a mechanism by which <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>η</mi></math></span> can be amplified by the modulated response, and these normally stochastic events can occur with high regularity. We provide a modeling framework that explains the observed amplitude and phase responses, and we extend this approach to make predictions for the occurrence of cessation events and the probability distributions of <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>θ</mi><mo>̇</mo></mover><mrow><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></span> and <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>δ</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow></math></span> during different phases of a modulation cycle, based on an adiabatic approach that treats each phase separately. Last, we show that such periodic forcing has consequences beyond influencing LSC dynamics, by investigating how it can modify the heat transport even under conditions where the Ekman pumping effect is predominant and strong enhancement of heat transport occurs. We identify phase and amplitude responses of the heat transport, and we show how increased modulations influence the average Nusselt number.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"2d276ce6-c803-4ba3-813c-b989f2d4bfde","label":"Convection & buoyancy-driven flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"062f0300c33d4782b24c43996b0469f3","label":"Turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

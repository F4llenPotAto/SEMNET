These advantages are hindered when liquid penetrates the gas cavities (Wenzel state), and this is commonly referred to as impalement. Current efforts to drive impaled liquid out of, or dewet, the cavities—such as boiling or mechanical vibrations—are locally disruptive to the flow. In this work, we reveal that passive dewetting is possible during droplet impingement on micropillar substrates under the right thermodynamical conditions. Exploration included substrates with pillar-to-pillar spacing of 8 and <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>16</mn><mspace width=\"4pt\"></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></mrow></math></span>, pillar diameters of 3 and <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>6</mn><mspace width=\"4pt\"></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></mrow></math></span>, and pillar heights of 4 to <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>8</mn><mspace width=\"4pt\"></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></mrow></math></span> and 8 to <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>18</mn><mspace width=\"4pt\"></mspace><mi>μ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></mrow></math></span>, respectively.

Results revealed that dewetting increases with increasing pillar height and increasing substrate temperature. Two hypotheses for the driving mechanism are formulated based on evaporation and surface energy. First-order models are consequently constructed, revealing that dewetting does not occur due to evaporation, but is caused by surface energy gradients at the interface. Dissipation in the flow is taken into account due to hydrodynamic and nonhydrodynamic mechanisms; the latter is found to dominate resistance.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"f5372742-fa5e-4bda-96ba-87e45d98bae6","label":"Interfacial flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"30ee2f3d-e006-4dd1-93d9-dd85f7de78f2","label":"Drop interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"edff6507-ef6e-4655-88ac-33fa3e31b6fb","label":"Microscale flows","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"795375d2194f4f098b48acc3c7c5dd4b","label":"Drops","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}}]}}}

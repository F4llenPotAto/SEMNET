Power-law trends for the coalescence time as a function of droplet radius and compression force are experimentally measured. The measurements are compared against several different scaling theories from the literature. One of the existing theories is found to correctly predict the dependence on the droplet radius, but all of the theories overpredict the dependence on the force. A transition is also observed in the measured drainage time from a small variation around a single deterministic value for droplets with a radius of 125 <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>µ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></math></span> or less to a broad distribution of drainage times for droplets with a radius of 150 <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>µ</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">m</mi></math></span>.

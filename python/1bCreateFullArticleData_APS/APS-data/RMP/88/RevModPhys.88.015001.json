This review gives a survey of results from these studies. Most of these investigations have been of systems of gauge fields and fermions that have slowly running coupling constants. A major portion of the review is a critical discussion of work in this particular subfield, first describing the methods used and then giving a compilation of results for specific models.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"9f5c878e-b7b7-4030-bdb9-21a24ad97422","label":"Particles & Fields"}],"concepts":[{"id":"f9878664-4f0f-49a5-ae1c-9d7d9ce789f6","label":"Extensions of Higgs sector","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"908b92a6-5196-437c-a2f3-aa1885f5396a","label":"Dynamical symmetry breaking models","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"612f281837e64798ac55d67bb4053702","label":"Lattice gauge theory","facet":{"id":"b96dac97-ab85-4320-892d-9b245caf097f","label":"Theoretical Techniques"},"primary":true}]}}}

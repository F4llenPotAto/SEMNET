LCLS provides femtosecond pulses of x rays (270 eV to 11.2 keV) with very high peak brightness to access new domains of ultrafast x-ray science. This article presents the fundamental FEL physics and outlines the LCLS source characteristics along with the experimental challenges, strategies, and instrumentation that accompany this novel type of x-ray source. The main part of the article reviews the scientific achievements since the inception of LCLS in the five primary areas it serves: atomic, molecular, and optical physics; condensed matter physics; matter in extreme conditions; chemistry and soft matter, and biology.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"c3ec1cb0fc2e4669a886a82178c6ceda","label":"Accelerators & Beams"}],"concepts":[{"id":"8630c41a-a825-46b6-b635-0b356fc9ebf6","label":"Free-electron laser acceleration","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"d03a9a05-6cbb-40c9-b754-81f248538cf0","label":"X-ray lasers","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}}]}}}

In some cases, entire detectors or technologies developed specifically for particle physics research have been adopted by other fields of research or in commercial applications. In most cases, however, the development of new devices and technologies by particle physics for its own research has added value to other fields of research or to applications beneficial to society by integrating them in the existing technologies. Thus, detector research and development has not only advanced the current state of technology for particle physics, but has often advanced research in other fields of science and has underpinned progress in numerous applications in medicine and national security. At the same time particle physics has profited immensely from developments in industry and applied them to great benefit for the use of particle physics detectors. This symbiotic relationship has seen strong mutual benefits with sometimes unexpected far reach.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"c3ec1cb0fc2e4669a886a82178c6ceda","label":"Accelerators & Beams"},{"id":"9f5c878e-b7b7-4030-bdb9-21a24ad97422","label":"Particles & Fields"},{"id":"0213a5a0-0742-43f3-804b-3ccea08a13c0","label":"Nuclear Physics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"2aa60c9a-e26a-4bc7-8eb8-c6051a22fae2","label":"Multi-purpose particle detectors","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}},{"id":"9557aa4972bb404dafe976ca9e5e5ef2","label":"Neutrino detectors","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}},{"id":"d94b540a-e0d6-40ef-9e71-d39129278bd5","label":"Gaseous detectors","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}},{"id":"f27a3e9c-1897-4ee8-9270-edd2d637fe86","label":"Radiation detectors","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}},{"id":"9527142a-3609-4c45-ac29-2e0620a6eff9","label":"Cherenkov detectors","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}},{"id":"be8bd934-5bc9-4a6d-ae73-f4753ce5c128","label":"Particle detectors","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"},"primary":true}]}}}

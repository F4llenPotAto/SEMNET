All these disordered materials display a nonlinear flow behavior in response to external mechanical forces due to the existence of a finite force threshold for flow to occur: the yield stress. Both the physical origin and rheological consequences associated with this nonlinear behavior are discussed and an overview is given of experimental techniques available to measure the yield stress. Recent progress is discussed concerning a microscopic theoretical description of the flow dynamics of yield stress materials, emphasizing, in particular, the role played by relaxation time scales, the interplay between shear flow and aging behavior, the existence of inhomogeneous shear flows and shear bands, wall slip, and nonlocal effects in confined geometries.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"2bd35371-7fda-477a-8e1a-c346c797a232","label":"Polymers & Soft Matter"}],"concepts":[{"id":"caa456953c0e40b9926b6502e4cb8b5a","label":"Yield stress","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"},"primary":true},{"id":"ef0a1bee2a1f4f47aca26302db18e67f","label":"Colloids","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"f2a9db7816514a94b66e3e3d72056760","label":"Phase transitions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"703a9d8c-f20e-4b6c-8840-5d80a681c821","label":"Wall slip","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"9c5b281b-03e8-44e5-bd2e-5ba452b0bd1a","label":"Shear flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"87e64a0fc93544dda3efae868d3a6389","label":"Rheology","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

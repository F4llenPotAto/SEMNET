The nodal statistics are shown to distinguish not only between regular and chaotic classical dynamics but also between different geometric shapes of the billiard system itself. How a random superposition of plane waves can model chaotic eigenfunctions is discussed and the connections of the complex morphology of the nodal lines thereof to percolation theory and Schramm-Loewner evolution are highlighted. Various approaches to counting the nodal domains—using trace formulas, graph theory, and difference equations—are also illustrated with examples. The nodal patterns addressed pertain to waves on vibrating plates and membranes, acoustic and electromagnetic modes, wave functions of a “particle in a box” as well as to percolating clusters, and domains in ferromagnets, thus underlining the diversity and far-reaching implications of the problem.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"780edcc1-705f-432b-9121-76105d540fe1","label":"General Physics"},{"id":"419d860ece5c42f1b6ad4dee9f4fbf60","label":"Statistical Physics"},{"id":"6f025065-4b96-4156-b146-2c285d0994c4","label":"Nonlinear Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"645b6143-f550-4fbd-9800-3a1da372088f","label":"Schroedinger equation","facet":{"id":"b96dac97-ab85-4320-892d-9b245caf097f","label":"Theoretical Techniques"}},{"id":"519fd613-c37e-4ce3-b9f4-8971cb6273e8","label":"Quantum billiards","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true}]}}}

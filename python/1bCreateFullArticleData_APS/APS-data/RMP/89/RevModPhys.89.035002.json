Historical examples of quantum sensors include magnetometers based on superconducting quantum interference devices and atomic vapors or atomic clocks. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology, with the most common platforms being spin qubits, trapped ions, and flux qubits. The field is expected to provide new opportunities—especially with regard to high sensitivity and precision—in applied physics and other areas of science. This review provides an introduction to the basic principles, methods, and concepts of quantum sensing from the viewpoint of the interested experimentalist.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"510fc21887744547ab09fc6cef0c9a03","label":"Quantum Information"}],"concepts":[{"id":"c9f142c1-4ecb-437a-8586-97957a1ebdba","label":"Quantum control","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

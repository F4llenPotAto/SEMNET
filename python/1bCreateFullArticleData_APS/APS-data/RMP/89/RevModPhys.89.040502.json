I will describe the history and background of three discoveries cited in this Nobel Prize: The “TKNN” topological formula for the integer quantum Hall effect found by David Thouless and collaborators, the Chern insulator or quantum anomalous Hall effect, and its role in the later discovery of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators, and the unexpected topological spin-liquid state of the spin-1 quantum antiferromagnetic chain, which provided an initial example of topological quantum matter. I will summarize how these early beginnings have led to the exciting, and currently extremely active, field of “topological matter.”</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"780edcc1-705f-432b-9121-76105d540fe1","label":"General Physics"},{"id":"e4211828-5d99-4bc4-b986-eb2bbbc8b248","label":"Interdisciplinary Physics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"58e53b96a1ff46ed8659fc631cef385d","label":"Topological phase transition","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"91dc0639-6f1c-438a-907b-22864452c003","label":"Topological defects","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"bfe403ee-cd34-466b-b8bf-f90b4d4431fc","label":"Topological phases of matter","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

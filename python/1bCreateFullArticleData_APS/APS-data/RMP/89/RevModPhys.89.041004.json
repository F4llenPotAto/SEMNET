First, they are phases of matter at zero temperature. Second, they have a nonzero energy gap for the excitations above the ground state. Third, they are disordered liquids that seem to have no feature. But those disordered liquids actually can have rich patterns of many-body entanglement representing new kinds of order. This Colloquium gives a simple introduction and a brief survey of topological phases of matter. First topological phases with topological order (i.e., with long-range entanglement) are discussed. Then topological phases without topological order (i.e., with short-range entanglement) are covered.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"a48f173e-6459-4642-a711-a6e731807625","label":"Condensed Matter & Materials Physics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"bfe403ee-cd34-466b-b8bf-f90b4d4431fc","label":"Topological phases of matter","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

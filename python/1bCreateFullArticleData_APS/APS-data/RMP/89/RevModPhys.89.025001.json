The study of the properties of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by gas or stars orbiting these objects can potentially test the Kerr black hole hypothesis. This paper reviews the state of the art of this research field, describing the possible approaches to test the Kerr metric with current and future observational facilities and discussing current constraints.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"0f4313da-ec73-46f5-b24f-521a1fcb6db7","label":"Gravitation, Cosmology & Astrophysics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"913cd3ee-a6c6-4c54-873c-08e0415a3d96","label":"General relativity equations & solutions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"893ecc24-c678-4687-bd3a-0b4a1bcb4cfc","label":"Electromagnetic radiation astronomy","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"27862afe-0467-49b2-a792-5b376b520666","label":"Astronomical black holes","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true}]}}}

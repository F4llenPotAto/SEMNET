It provides a historical background and literature survey, but focuses on recent progress, identifying the most exciting new scientific results and pointing to promising future research directions. It starts with an introduction and overview of how basic magnetic properties are affected by interfaces, then turns to a discussion of charge and spin transport through and near interfaces and how these can be used to control the properties of the magnetic layer. Important concepts include spin accumulation, spin currents, spin-transfer torque, and spin pumping. An overview is provided to the current state of knowledge and existing review literature on interfacial effects such as exchange bias, exchange-spring magnets, the spin Hall effect, oxide heterostructures, and topological insulators. The article highlights recent discoveries of interface-induced magnetism and noncollinear spin textures, nonlinear dynamics including spin-transfer torque and magnetization reversal induced by interfaces, and interfacial effects in ultrafast magnetization processes.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"a48f173e-6459-4642-a711-a6e731807625","label":"Condensed Matter & Materials Physics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"0ed84e5412b149068906632d48bb90e9","label":"Spin current","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"d602a656-c57b-4004-b015-230b610f2bb2","label":"Micromagnetism","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"0e380d9dccad467dabf77ab154e42c86","label":"Magnetotransport","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"1ae8b922-d896-41cc-bfff-6649f254bb1d","label":"Magnetization switching","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"1bd1a9abec4f40a89f819f1005587d58","label":"Magnetic texture","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"1f68adf2-72ef-4afa-8536-fd5094c2edd5","label":"Magnetic interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"99c1e71a163942a58e006e258fc0b4f5","label":"Hall effect","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"b35238d083c74412b293c7d42fa92c62","label":"Magnetism","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

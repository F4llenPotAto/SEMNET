The inherent randomness at the core of quantum mechanics makes quantum systems a perfect source of entropy. Quantum random number generation is one of the most mature quantum technologies with many alternative generation methods. This review discusses the different technologies in quantum random number generation from the early devices based on radioactive decay to the multiple ways to use the quantum states of light to gather entropy from a quantum origin. Randomness extraction and amplification and the notable possibility of generating trusted random numbers even with untrusted hardware using device-independent generation protocols are also discussed.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"510fc21887744547ab09fc6cef0c9a03","label":"Quantum Information"}],"concepts":[{"id":"f464ad01-629c-41f3-98bc-195c920e4d42","label":"Quantum measurements","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"b25ae464-8a45-4e8e-8efe-63d0f4714f01","label":"Networks & random structures","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}}]}}}

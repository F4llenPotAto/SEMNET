The file FromScratch.m is the navigator for creating a semantic network from data,
and using it for predicting future research trends using artificial
neural networks.
 
The code is far from clean. if you have any questions, dont hasitate to 
contact me: mario.krenn@univie.ac.at

## Additional Infos
The code needs the Bioinformatics and the Neural Network toolbox from MATLAB. Also, file paths are written using windows syntax, and need to be changed when running on Mac or Linux.

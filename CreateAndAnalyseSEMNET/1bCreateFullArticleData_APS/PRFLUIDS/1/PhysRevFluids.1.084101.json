This is particularly true in the development of vector chromatography at vanishingly small Reynolds number for non-Brownian particles. Note that this latter phenomenon has its origins in the irreversible forces that are at work in the device, since Stokes flow reversibility typically prohibits their function otherwise. We present a numerical simulation of the vector separation of non-Brownian particles of different sizes and deformabilities in the Stokes flow through channels whose lower surface is composed of slanted cavities. The simulations are designed to understand the physical principles behind the separation as well as to provide design criteria for devices for separating particles in a given size and flexibility range. The numerical simulations are Stokes flow boundary element simulations using techniques defined elsewhere in the literature, but including a close-range repulsive force between the particles and the slanted cavities. We demonstrate that over a range of repulsive force that is comparable to the roughness in the experimental devices, the separation data (particularly in particle size) are predicted quantitatively and are a very weak function of the range of the force. We then vary the geometric parameters of the simulated devices to demonstrate the sensitivity of the separation efficiency to these parameters, thus making design predictions as to which devices are appropriate for separating particles in different size, shape, and deformability ranges.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"c577bd62-ea57-43b7-9607-1ef45dba3afb","label":"Multiphase flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"edff6507-ef6e-4655-88ac-33fa3e31b6fb","label":"Microscale flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

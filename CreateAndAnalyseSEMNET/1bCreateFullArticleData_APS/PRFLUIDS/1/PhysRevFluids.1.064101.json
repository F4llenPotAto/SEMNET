Prior work has reported that a finite length <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>∞</mi></msub></math></span> of the capillary groove can remain indefinitely filled with liquid even when large shear stresses are applied. The mechanism preventing full drainage is attributed to a balance between the shear-driven flow and a counterflow driven by capillary pressures caused by deformation of the free surface. In this work, we examine closely the approach to the final equilibrium length <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>∞</mi></msub></math></span> and report a crossover to a slow drainage regime that cannot be described by conventional dynamic models considering solely hydrodynamic and capillary forces. The slow drainage regime observed in experiments can be instead modeled by a kinetic equation describing a sequence of random thermally activated transitions between multiple metastable states caused by surface defects with nanoscale dimensions. Our findings provide insights on the critical role that natural or engineered surface roughness with nanoscale dimensions can play in the imbibition and drainage of capillaries and other dynamic wetting processes in microscale systems.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"131dafdf93a44e0abba0a8b40cb90b6c","label":"Wetting","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"36c186b3-6f92-4d27-a215-e59d74aa95b6","label":"Interfacial phenomena","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"edff6507-ef6e-4655-88ac-33fa3e31b6fb","label":"Microscale flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

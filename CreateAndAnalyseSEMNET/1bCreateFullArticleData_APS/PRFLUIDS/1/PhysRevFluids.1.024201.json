The work focuses on the interaction of particles with the obstacle and the flow behavior in and around the recirculating wake behind the obstacle. Motivated by microfluidic experiments of dilute suspension flow over obstacles of circular, square, and other shapes showing depletion of particles in the wake behind the obstacle, we focus on the entry and exit from the wake for isolated particles, small groups of particles, and a suspension of many particles. All work is at conditions well below the Reynolds number for the transition to unsteady flow and vortex shedding. The dynamics of an isolated particle inside the recirculating wake flow exhibits motion toward a limit cycle near the outer boundary of the wake. By increasing particle density above the fluid and increasing the size of the particle, we determine the upper limits of these variables yielding a limit cycle trajectory. Hydrodynamic interaction between particles in a many-particle suspension is shown to lead to exchange of particles between the wake zone and free stream.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"52399a41-c27b-49c2-96c3-120524795d0b","label":"Complex fluids","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"63f8b3b2-4f01-4ed3-8256-e8c63afc6ddb","label":"Particle-laden flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"c577bd62-ea57-43b7-9607-1ef45dba3afb","label":"Multiphase flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

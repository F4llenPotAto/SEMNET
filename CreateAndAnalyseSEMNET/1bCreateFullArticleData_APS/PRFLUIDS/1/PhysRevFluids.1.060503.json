Two well-known examples that have been studied by both theory and experiment are the catenoid suspended between circular wires in parallel planes, and the Möbius-strip soap film spanning a wire that is twisted and folded back on itself. In this latter case, we have shown in previous publications that, when the wire is unfolded, the soap film undergoes a topological transition through a boundary singularity to a two-sided film, with a corresponding jump in the linking number between the axis of the wire and the Plateau boundary on its surface. Here, we review this particular aspect of the problem, and propose a simplified model experiment through which the slipping adjustment of a Plateau border on a solid surface may be investigated.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"8f585b75-23e9-4388-afe5-364824c412da","label":"Surface tension effects","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

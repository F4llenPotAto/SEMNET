The flow is analyzed using proper orthogonal decomposition and it is shown that the flow can be divided into two regions: a pseudolaminar region governed by the presence of azimuthally steady traveling waves, and turbulent slugs. The evolution of the structures within the slugs is identified by using the temporally resolved data along with the dual-plane velocity field. These structures are shown to be remarkably similar to the large-scale motions found in fully turbulent flows, with a streamwise and spatiotemporal extent about four pipe radii. The transition between structures is characterized by the detachment and decay of an old structure and the initiation of a new structure at the wall.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"e6ada997-f540-4edc-acae-073c259e6e78","label":"Transition to turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"10c138e7-fbf9-4875-938c-c1e84ad5e598","label":"Structure & turbulence of boundary layers","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

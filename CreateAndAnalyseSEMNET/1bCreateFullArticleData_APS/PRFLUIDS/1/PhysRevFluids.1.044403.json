Three-dimensional particle-tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV) and direct numerical simulations (DNS) are employed at three different heights within the cylindrical cell. The Lagrangian velocity fluctuation and second-order Eulerian structure function are utilized to evaluate the large-scale isotropy for different rotation rates. Furthermore, we examine the experimental measurements of the Lagrangian acceleration of neutrally buoyant particles and the second-order Eulerian structure function to evaluate the small-scale isotropy as a function of rotation rate. It is found that background rotation enhances large-scale anisotropy at the cell center and close to the top plate, while decreases it at intermediate height. The large-scale anisotropy, induced by rotation, has negligible effect on the small scales at the cell center, whereas the small scales remain anisotropic close to the top plate.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"c21e7551-f63c-435d-8997-614152843b63","label":"Lagrangian particle tracking","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}},{"id":"2d276ce6-c803-4ba3-813c-b989f2d4bfde","label":"Convection & buoyancy-driven flows","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true},{"id":"062f0300c33d4782b24c43996b0469f3","label":"Turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

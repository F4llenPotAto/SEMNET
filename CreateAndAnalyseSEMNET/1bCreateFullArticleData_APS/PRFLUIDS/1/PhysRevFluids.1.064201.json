A bidisperse mixture of particles, initially normally graded, flows down an inclined chute and impacts with a closed end. This impact causes the formation of a shock in flow thickness, known as a granular bore, to travel upslope, leaving behind a thick deposit. This deposit imprints the local segregated state featuring both pure and mixed regions of particles as a function of downstream position. The particle-size distribution through the depth is characterized by a thin purely small-particle layer at the base, a significant linear transition region, and a thick constant mixed-particle layer below the surface, in contrast to previously observed S-shaped steady-state concentration profiles. The experimental observations agree with recent progress that upward and downward segregation of large and small particles respectively is asymmetric. We incorporate the three-layer, experimentally observed, size-distribution profile into a depth-averaged segregation model to modify it accordingly. Numerical solutions of this model are able to match our experimental results and therefore motivate the use of a more general particle-size distribution profile.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"9f5c878e-b7b7-4030-bdb9-21a24ad97422","label":"Particles & Fields"},{"id":"6f025065-4b96-4156-b146-2c285d0994c4","label":"Nonlinear Dynamics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"7b5faa1f2c6c404784b32f4b22882590","label":"Dry granular materials","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"e8836b5da34841e49d9e30e950115672","label":"Granular materials","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"42aa5bda-1368-4a05-bc0c-86f3e83a7d2c","label":"Mixing, segregation, & separation","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"39bed7a0-3273-4d2a-a261-5f80d6011fb6","label":"Granular segregation","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"8da11568-256e-4eba-ac10-f750c272b3ca","label":"Granular flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

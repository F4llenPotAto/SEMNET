The reverse dewetting transition is hampered by a large energy barrier and in order to achieve it, external fields are usually applied. Here we perform experiments, theoretical analysis, and lattice Boltzmann simulations of droplet condensation on a patterned superhydrophobic surface and demonstrate that the dewetting energy barrier can be reduced by manipulating the adhesion forces. Moreover, the kinetics of dewetting is a result of a subtle interplay of wetting and adhesion and in certain geometries, such as cone-shaped texture, the dewetting transition from Wenzel to Cassie state becomes spontaneous.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"3b03f814-6aa3-4481-b375-262d7f211ef5","label":"Wetting transitions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"7f108020-6bca-4019-a4e7-69c187060ed3","label":"Dewetting","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

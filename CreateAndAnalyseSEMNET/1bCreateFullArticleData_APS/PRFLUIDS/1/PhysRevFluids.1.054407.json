We use numerical simulations to consider cases in which the mechanical forcing injects (or not) helicity in the flow. As the guide field is increased, the strength of the magnetic field fluctuations decreases as a power law of the guide field intensity. We show that for strong enough guide fields the helical magnetohydrodynamic flow can become almost two-dimensional. In this case, the mechanical energy can undergo a process compatible with an inverse cascade, being transferred preferentially towards scales larger than the forcing scale. The presence of helicity changes the spectral scaling of the small magnetic field fluctuations, and affects the statistics of the velocity field and of the velocity gradients. Moreover, at small scales the dynamics of the flow becomes dominated by a direct cascade of helicity, which can be used to derive scaling laws for the velocity field.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"5375b253-b0a1-4ece-bb50-4c34ea7218bd","label":"Plasma Physics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"c25108e7-4697-4565-b484-221b808d454e","label":"Magnetohydrodynamics","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"062f0300c33d4782b24c43996b0469f3","label":"Turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"f713ae72-a647-44e9-ac36-df249c5fd2c3","label":"Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

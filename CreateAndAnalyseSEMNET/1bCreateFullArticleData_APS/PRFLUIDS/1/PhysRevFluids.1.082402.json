The stationary statistics of the bending angle shows a strong dependence on the dimension of the flow. In two-dimensional turbulence, particles are found in either a fully extended or a fully folded configuration; in three dimensions, the predominant configuration is the fully extended one. Such a sensitivity of the bending statistics on the dimensionality of the flow is peculiar to fluctuating flows and is not observed in laminar stretching flows.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"2bd35371-7fda-477a-8e1a-c346c797a232","label":"Polymers & Soft Matter"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

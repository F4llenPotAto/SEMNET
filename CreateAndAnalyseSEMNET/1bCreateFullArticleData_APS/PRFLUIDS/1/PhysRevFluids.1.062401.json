This mixing behavior is dictated by the kinematic viscosity <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ν</mi></math></span> for a laminar jet, which can be dramatically enhanced in a turbulent flow and is represented by the eddy viscosity <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ɛ</mi></math></span>. Similarly, pulsation in a synthetic jet is identified as another mechanism for enhancing mixing, which can be captured by an enhanced eddy viscosity beyond what is observed in a corresponding turbulent continuous jet. To this end, an effective-eddy-viscosity concept is proposed to model any excitation of a jet that could result in enhanced mixing beyond what is predicted by the kinematic viscosity. Our previous study found that <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ɛ</mi></math></span> is actuator dependent and its relationship with the spreading or decay behavior of a jet is not obvious. To remove the actuator dependence, this study performs a dimensional analysis to relate the spreading and decay behaviors to a scaled effective eddy viscosity <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>ɛ</mi><mo>/</mo><msqrt><mi>K</mi></msqrt></mrow></math></span> (<span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>K</mi></math></span> is the momentum flux).

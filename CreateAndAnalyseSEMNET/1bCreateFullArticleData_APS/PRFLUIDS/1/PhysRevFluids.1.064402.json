Together, the arrangements resolve scales ranging from motions on the order of the Kolmogorov microscale to those longer than twice the boundary layer thickness. The rough-wall experiments were obtained above a continuous sandpaper sheet, identical to that used by Squire <i>et al.</i> [<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2016.196\"><span>J. Fluid Mech.</span> <b>795</b>, 210 (2016)</a>], and cover a range of friction and equivalent sand-grain roughness Reynolds numbers (<span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>12</mn><mspace width=\"0.28em\"></mspace><mn>000</mn><mo>≲</mo><msup><mi>δ</mi><mo>+</mo></msup><mo>≲</mo></mrow></math></span> 18000, <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mn>62</mn><mo>≲</mo><msubsup><mi>k</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>+</mo></msubsup><mo>≲</mo><mn>104</mn></mrow></math></span>).

Flow statistics from all experiments show similar Reynolds number trends and behaviors to recent, well-resolved hot-wire anemometry measurements above the same rough surface.

This is apparently true even at wall-normal locations where the total (inner-normalized) energy differs between the smooth and rough wall.

Experiments consisting of a castor oil drop suspended in silicone oil are compared against axisymmetric boundary integral computations that account for transient charging, or charge relaxation, of the interface. A temporal asymmetry between the drop deformation and relaxation processes is observed in the experiments and computations: The drop relaxes back to its spherical equilibrium shape faster than the time taken to achieve its steady-state deformation. During the deformation process, the electrical (Maxwell) stress deforms the drop along the direction of the applied field; it is counteracted by the capillary stress. During the relaxation process, i.e., after the field is removed, the electrical stress acts together with the capillary stress to quickly restore the drop back to equilibrium. This change in action of the electrical stress is responsible for the asymmetry between the drop deformation and relaxation. Notably, the electrical stress acts over the charge relaxation time scales of the fluids: Thus, counterintuitively, longer charging time scales yield faster drop relaxation. That is, the longer it takes for the interface to discharge, the faster the drop shape relaxes. We also present computational results for a drop that does not relax back to its initial spherical shape upon removal of the electric field; rather, the drop breaks up via an end-pinching mechanism.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"e5358f39-64b8-4348-a186-972b03245d1d","label":"Fluid flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

Previous attempts to find singular flow structures have proven inconclusive. We reconsider the problem of interacting vortex tubes, for which it has long been observed that the flattening of the vortices inhibits sustained self-amplification of velocity gradients. Here we consider an iterative mechanism, based on the transformation of vortex filaments into sheets and their subsequent instability back into filaments. Elementary fluid mechanical arguments are provided to support the formation of a singular structure via this iterated mechanism, which we analyze based on a simplified model of filament interactions.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"a3ff37a7-c0a4-48a9-a32f-0dbc060c2746","label":"Navier-Stokes equation","facet":{"id":"b96dac97-ab85-4320-892d-9b245caf097f","label":"Theoretical Techniques"},"primary":true},{"id":"9fa410c9-2586-4115-8dca-190b22421a01","label":"Vortex flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

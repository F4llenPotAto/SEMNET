A method has been proposed to extract the basic characteristics of thermal plumes from temporal temperature measurement inside the convection cell. It has been found that both plume amplitude <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>A</mi></math></span> and cap width <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>w</mi></math></span>, in a time domain, are approximately in the log-normal distribution. In particular, the normalized most probable front width is found to be a characteristic scale of thermal plumes, which is much larger than the thermal boundary layer thickness. Over a wide range of the Rayleigh number, the statistical characterizations of the thermal fluctuations of plumes, and the turbulent background, the plume front width and plume spacing have been discussed and compared with the theoretical predictions and morphological observations. For the most part good agreements have been found with the direct observations.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"6f025065-4b96-4156-b146-2c285d0994c4","label":"Nonlinear Dynamics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"2d276ce6-c803-4ba3-813c-b989f2d4bfde","label":"Convection & buoyancy-driven flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"062f0300c33d4782b24c43996b0469f3","label":"Turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

The films are surrounded by pure vapor in a capillary heated above the saturation temperature. We observe the substrate dewetting with the dewetting ridge in spite of the complete wetting at equilibrium. The dewetting is caused by a high contact angle (<span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mo>∼</mo><msup><mn>30</mn><mo>∘</mo></msup></mrow></math></span>) induced by evaporation. The obtained values agree with a theory proposed earlier. The film shape is measured with both grid deflection technique and interferometry. The phenomenon is convenient to observe inside a capillary with an axial thermal gradient. When the capillary is closed at one end and open at another to a constant pressure reservoir, the meniscus oscillations are known to appear spontaneously. Such a system is the simplest version of an industrial device called a pulsating heat pipe. The effect is general and can be used in any system to control the wetting properties.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"a48f173e-6459-4642-a711-a6e731807625","label":"Condensed Matter & Materials Physics"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"246ded35-faf5-4395-a28d-c69e648998a0","label":"Capillary interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"7dfdd1db-3f72-4352-ae84-b3a05e0543ac","label":"Contact line dynamics","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"7f108020-6bca-4019-a4e7-69c187060ed3","label":"Dewetting","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

The effects of the confining boundary, its curvature, particle size, and particle density variations are investigated. To reveal how the nature of the temporal correlations (hydrodynamic memory) in the inertial regime is altered by the full hydrodynamic interaction due to the confining boundaries, we employ the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method to determine the dynamical relaxation of a spherical NP located at various positions in the medium over a wide span of time scales compared to the fluid viscous relaxation time <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msub><mi>τ</mi><mi>ν</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>/</mo><mi>ν</mi></mrow></math></span>, where <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>a</mi></math></span> is the spherical particle radius and <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>ν</mi></math></span> is the kinematic viscosity. The results show that, as compared to the behavior of a particle in regions away from the confining boundary, the velocity autocorrelation function for a particle in the lubrication layer initially decays exponentially with a Stokes drag enhanced by a factor that is proportional to the ratio of the particle radius to the gap thickness between the particle and the wall.

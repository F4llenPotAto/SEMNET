Vortical structures within the transverse grooves were caused by a slip velocity at the fluid-fluid interface and act as “fluid bearings” on the boundary to lubricate the flow of the continuous phase. We investigated the drag reduction in the laminar flow in the microchannel by measuring slip at the boundaries and calculating an effective slip length, taking into account the influence of the effect of the viscosity ratio of the two fluids on the effective slip length. The “fluid bearing” effect can be used to transport high viscosity fluids using low viscosity fluids trapped in cavities to reduce drag.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"6605a120-b9af-4162-b9b5-28f6575f8183","label":"Liquid-liquid interfaces","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"f1a3e49abcd24cd8aa2d6d4dbbeec303","label":"Slip boundary effects","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"5c98e96f-9b4d-4af7-9105-c87cd60b2ab5","label":"Flows in microchannels","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

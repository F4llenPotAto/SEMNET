In this regime the particles are known to show a variety of motions [Jenny, Dušek, and Bouchet, Instabilities and transition of a sphere falling or ascending freely in a Newtonian fluid, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022112004009164\"><span>J.

It is known that the wake undergoes several transitions for increasing <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Ga</mtext></math></span> resulting in particle motions that are successively vertical, oblique, oblique oscillating, and finally chaotic. Not only does this change the trajectory of single, isolated, settling particles, but it also changes the dynamics of a swarm of particles as collective effects become important even for dilute suspensions with volume fraction up to <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Φ</mi><mi>V</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><mi>O</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></span>, which are investigated in this work. Multicamera recordings of settling particles are recorded and tracked over time in three dimensions. A variety of analyses are performed and show a strong clustering behavior. The distribution of the cell areas of the Voronoï tessellation in the horizontal plane is compared to that of a random distribution of particles and shows clear clustering. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between the Voronoï area and the particle velocity; clustered particles fall faster. In addition, the angle between adjacent particles and the vertical is calculated and compared to a homogeneous distribution of particles, clear evidence of vertical alignment of particles is found. The experimental findings are compared to simulations.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"f0e2a1b3-ef9a-491f-b610-4506f0cc4020","label":"Interparticle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"63f8b3b2-4f01-4ed3-8256-e8c63afc6ddb","label":"Particle-laden flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

By taking account of the spanwise velocity, the circulation based on the streamwise vorticity is derived from an inviscid flow around the strut. The theoretical circulations are in agreement with the values obtained from three-dimensional numerical simulations for small slope angles at a Mach number of 2.48. Therefore, the proposed circulation formula can contribute to designing struts, in that it depends only on the strut configuration and inflow conditions. This study also finds that the linear relations between circulation and angle is broken by separated flows on the slope wall with increasing angle and the maximum value in circulation is expressed as a product of the mainstream velocity and the height of the strut.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"9fa410c9-2586-4115-8dca-190b22421a01","label":"Vortex flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"5cf50e0b-bcbc-491b-9fb3-4684dc9a20e5","label":"Mixing","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

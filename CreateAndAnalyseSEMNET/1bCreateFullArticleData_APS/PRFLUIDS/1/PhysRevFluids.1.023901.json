The first liquid layer rests on a vibrating solid plate and is overlaid by a second layer of immiscible fluid with deformable upper surface. Surface waves, excited as the result of the Faraday instability, can be characterized by a time-dependent relative amplitude of the displacements of the liquid-liquid and the liquid-gas interfaces. The in-phase displacements are associated with a zigzag (barotropic) mode and the antiphase displacement corresponds to the varicose thinning mode. We numerically determine the stability threshold in the vibrated two-layer film and compute the dispersion relation together with the decay rates of the surface waves in the absence of vibration. The in-phase and the antiphase displacements are strongly coupled in the vibrated system. The interplay between the Faraday and the Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the system with heavier fluid on top of a lighter fluid is analyzed.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"cd96a15b-7a3d-41a0-b914-072e0941bbb8","label":"Thin fluid films","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true},{"id":"42ec6252-ac7f-42bd-9ddc-08ac45a4b4e9","label":"Surface instabilities","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

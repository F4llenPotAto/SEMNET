When inner dissipation is vanishing, the limiting factor to high flux lies in the viscous dissipation occurring at the tube mouth. As shown by Gravelle <i>et al.</i> [Gravelle, Joly, Detcheverry, Ybert, Cottin-Bizonne, and Bocquet, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1306447110\"><span>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA</span> <b>110</b>, 16367 (2013)</a>], these so-called end effects can be reduced by adding a conical entrance. In this work, we take a step further and search for the optimal entrance shape. We use finite element calculations to compute the hydrodynamic resistance of a frictionless tube with superellipse-shaped entrances and propose an approximate analytical model. If perfect slip applies on its wall, an optimal entrance which is only 10 tube radii in length is sufficient to reduce end effects by an order of magnitude, a performance almost three times better than the optimal cone. In the case of partial slip, the resistance decreases with the entrance length before reaching a plateau at an optimal length controlled by liquid-solid slip. Our results are discussed in connection with biological and artificial systems.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"c7102703-2c55-4648-bf60-11f0f66a1256","label":"Nanoscale flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

Smoother particles lead to a larger critical strain amplitude. A geometrical model based on the assumption that colliding particles produce irreversibility is derived. The model, which considers a quasiparticle having a strain- and roughness-dependent effective volume, successfully reproduces the measured values of the critical strain amplitude as functions of the volume fraction and particle roughness.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"87e64a0fc93544dda3efae868d3a6389","label":"Rheology","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"63f8b3b2-4f01-4ed3-8256-e8c63afc6ddb","label":"Particle-laden flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"c577bd62-ea57-43b7-9607-1ef45dba3afb","label":"Multiphase flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}

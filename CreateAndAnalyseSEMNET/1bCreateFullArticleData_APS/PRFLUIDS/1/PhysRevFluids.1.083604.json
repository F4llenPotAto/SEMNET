Nonlinear simulations are carried out and reveal a permanent wave structure arising in unstable flow configurations. In addition, a weakly nonlinear analysis is performed and yields a Benney-type equation which has been solved both analytically and numerically. Good agreement between the linear stability analysis, weighted residual model, and weakly nonlinear analysis is found.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"8f585b75-23e9-4388-afe5-364824c412da","label":"Surface tension effects","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"50adc7d0-14e7-4a61-82ce-46d54feb45a9","label":"Instability of free-surface flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

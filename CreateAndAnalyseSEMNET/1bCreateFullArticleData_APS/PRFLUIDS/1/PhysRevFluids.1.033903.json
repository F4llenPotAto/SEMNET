The dynamics for filaments of differing length, diameter, and elastic modulus collapse to a single curve when the time dependence is scaled by a time scale <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>τ</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>8</mn><mi>π</mi><mi>μ</mi><msubsup><mi>L</mi><mi>o</mi><mn>4</mn></msubsup><mo>/</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow></math></span>. Even though the time <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>τ</mi></math></span> is obtained by comparing the linear bending and viscous forces, we find that it also controls the relaxation in the highly nonlinear regime of our experiments. The relaxation, however, is completed in a very small fraction of the time <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>τ</mi></math></span> due to a prefactor that changes with the tension in the nonlinear regime. Nonlinear numerical simulations show that the force due to tension along the filament is comparable to the bending force, producing a net elastic restoring force that is much smaller than either term. We perform particle image velocimetry at the liquid-air interface to support the results of the numerics. Finally, we find that when the filament is initialized in asymmetric shapes, it rapidly goes to a shape with symmetric stresses. This symmetrization process is entirely nonlinear; we show that the symmetric curvature state minimizes energy at arbitrarily large deformation.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"eaca2279-c165-4d8d-9d90-993209240f9e","label":"Low Reynolds number swimmers","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true}]}}}

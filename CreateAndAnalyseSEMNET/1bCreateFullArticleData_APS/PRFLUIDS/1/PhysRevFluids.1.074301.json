The data set supports the validity of the Priestley-Ball entrainment model in unstratified environments (excluding the region near the source) [Priestley and Ball, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.49708134803\"><span>Q.

We show that the second-order turbulence statistics in the core region of the jet and the plume are practically indistinguishable from each other, although there are significant differences near the plume edge. The DNS data indicate that the turbulent Prandtl number is about 0.7 for both jets and plumes. For plumes, this value is a result of the difference in the ratio of the radial turbulent transport of radial momentum and buoyancy. For jets, however, the value originates from a different spread of the buoyancy and velocity profiles, in spite of the fact that the ratio of radial turbulent transport terms is approximately unity. The DNS data do not show any evidence of similarity drift associated with gradual variations in the ratio of buoyancy profile to velocity profile widths.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"2d276ce6-c803-4ba3-813c-b989f2d4bfde","label":"Convection & buoyancy-driven flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"062f0300c33d4782b24c43996b0469f3","label":"Turbulence","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"4c984e2a-a745-480a-8a33-f96574b3bf03","label":"Wakes & jets","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

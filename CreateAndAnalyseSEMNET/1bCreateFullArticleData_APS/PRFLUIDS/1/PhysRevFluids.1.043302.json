By employing a thermoresponsive system that forms associative polymer-colloid networks, we present experiments of rheology and flow-induced microstructure on colloid-polymer mixtures in which the relative magnitudes of the time scales associated with relaxation of viscoelasticity and suspension microstructure are widely and controllably varied. In doing so, we explore several limits of relative magnitude of the relevant dimensionless shear rates, the Weissenberg number Wi and the Péclet number Pe. In all of these limits, we find that the fluid exhibits two distinct regimes of shear thinning at relatively low and high shear rates, in which the rheology collapses by scaling with Wi and Pe, respectively. Using three-dimensionally-resolved flow small-angle neutron scattering measurements, we observe clustering of the suspension above a critical shear rate corresponding to <span class=\"aps-inline-formula\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mrow><mi>Pe</mi><mo>∼</mo><mn>0.1</mn></mrow></math></span> over a wide range of fluid conditions, having anisotropy with projected orientation along both the vorticity and compressional axes of shear. The degree of anisotropy is shown to scale with Pe. From this we formulate an empirical model for the shear stress and viscosity, in which the viscoelastic network stress is augmented by an asymptotic shear thickening contribution due to hydrodynamic clustering. Overall, our results elucidate the significant role of hydrodynamic interactions in contributing to shear-induced clustering of Brownian suspensions in viscoelastic liquids.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"2bd35371-7fda-477a-8e1a-c346c797a232","label":"Polymers & Soft Matter"},{"id":"512fd433-7b6d-4535-bb60-78f3bf431bc3","label":"Fluid Dynamics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"a50e8ff6-ceef-409e-992a-b17cc2541ca6","label":"Aggregation","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"b14c11c6-6e81-44c1-a1ff-2ec4d1a95359","label":"Non-Newtonian fluids","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"8c304260-0dba-4a63-908f-bab534c0a876","label":"Viscoelasticity","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"a335b762-2f79-434e-9b50-42bdf4d91b52","label":"Shear deformation","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"d1dc41a8-e63f-419e-88a5-8e7aeb3cd01d","label":"Fluid-particle interactions","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"63f8b3b2-4f01-4ed3-8256-e8c63afc6ddb","label":"Particle-laden flows","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"d842863feee1451c9028a5bd499698c3","label":"Clustering","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true}]}}}

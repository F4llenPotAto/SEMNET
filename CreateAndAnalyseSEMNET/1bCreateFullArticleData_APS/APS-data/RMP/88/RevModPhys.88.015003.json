This article presents a review of about 10–15 years of research and development, mainly conducted within the CALICE Collaboration, for this novel type of detector. The performance of large-scale prototypes in beam tests validates the technical concept of particle flow calorimeters. The comparison of test-beam data with simulation, of, e.g., hadronic showers, supports full detector studies and gives deeper insight into the structure of hadronic cascades than was possible previously.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"9f5c878e-b7b7-4030-bdb9-21a24ad97422","label":"Particles & Fields"}],"concepts":[{"id":"341af387764f4d4592a54e36ea4fc215","label":"Hadronic decays","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"be8bd934-5bc9-4a6d-ae73-f4753ce5c128","label":"Particle detectors","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"},"primary":true}]}}}

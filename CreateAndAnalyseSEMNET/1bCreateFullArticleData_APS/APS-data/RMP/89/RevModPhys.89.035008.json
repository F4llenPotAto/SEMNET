The data were taken between 2010 and 2012. Limits on anomalous triple gauge couplings (aTGCs) then follow. In addition, data on electroweak triple gauge boson production and 2-to-2 vector boson scattering yield limits on anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings (aQGCs). The LHC hosts two general purpose experiments, ATLAS and CMS, which have both reported limits on aTGCs and aQGCs which are herein summarized. The interpretation of these limits in terms of an effective field theory is reviewed, and recommendations are made for testing other types of new physics using multigauge boson production.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"9f5c878e-b7b7-4030-bdb9-21a24ad97422","label":"Particles & Fields"}],"concepts":[{"id":"97069ede42dd4f4db5529fc8562cb02d","label":"Particle production","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"},"primary":true},{"id":"ee48744539e449959543fea1735bcbb2","label":"Electroweak interaction","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"44354e99eeb142399cd1af63ae10127e","label":"W & Z bosons","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"a93bbd60566f4c4cb6dfe93921384a8d","label":"Photons","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"}},{"id":"ff50fad48d0140438591e60769e24fa8","label":"Hadron colliders","facet":{"id":"705f7ed8-5e20-47e1-8ca4-fa7feea8ad84","label":"Experimental Techniques"}}]}}}

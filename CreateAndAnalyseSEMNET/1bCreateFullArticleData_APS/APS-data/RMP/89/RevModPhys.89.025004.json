The detected signals GW150914 and GW151226 have been used to examine the basic properties of these gravitational degrees of freedom, particularly setting an upper bound on their mass. It is timely to review what the mass of these gravitational degrees of freedom means from the theoretical point of view, particularly taking into account the recent developments in constructing consistent massive gravity theories. Apart from the GW150914 mass bound, a few other observational bounds have been established from the effects of the Yukawa potential, modified dispersion relation, and fifth force that are all induced when the fundamental gravitational degrees of freedom are massive. These different mass bounds are reviewed, how they stand in the wake of recent theoretical developments and how they compare to the bound from GW150914 are examined.</p>","format":"html+mathml"},"classificationSchemes":{"physh":{"disciplines":[{"id":"0f4313da-ec73-46f5-b24f-521a1fcb6db7","label":"Gravitation, Cosmology & Astrophysics"}],"concepts":[{"id":"e4a7e919778040839f699037a6703d76","label":"Lorentz symmetry","facet":{"id":"42d3b740-7576-46a7-8b8f-331568a778b1","label":"Properties"}},{"id":"a164d72c84d84332a3b1a9199a4f50ad","label":"Mass","facet":{"id":"42d3b740-7576-46a7-8b8f-331568a778b1","label":"Properties"}},{"id":"997c43cc-8b98-4bc8-a038-3436675ebf88","label":"Gravitons","facet":{"id":"f45b3c40-959c-4e90-ba0e-38232980802a","label":"Physical Systems"},"primary":true},{"id":"19eb7adc-6b41-43d6-b3a1-ccdd0a973e87","label":"Alternative gravity theories","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}},{"id":"453f63ad-c881-451c-b024-5d2b5aab7199","label":"Gravitational waves","facet":{"id":"bdb1ef91-b776-4e36-8f8f-3e93666bac1e","label":"Research Areas"}}]}}}
